**Dataset Description**

__Dataset Overview__  
This dataset contains RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power) measurements collected with a Samsung Galaxy A06 smartphone while walking at a speed of approximately 1 m/s. Each folder corresponds to data specific to a scientific publication.

__Data Format__  
The data is provided in the following CSV format:

latitude;longitude;signal


latitude : Latitude of the measurement point  
longitude : Longitude of the measurement point  
signal : RSRP value in dBm  

**RSRP Definition**  
RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power) is the average power level received from a single reference signal in a cellular network (typically LTE/4G). It is commonly used to evaluate the signal strength at a specific location.

**Antenna Information**  
The antenna used for these measurements is located at:  
Latitude: 5.438682687656856  
Longitude: -4.013691597501548  
Height: approximately 35 meters above ground level  

**Purpose**  
These data are made publicly available to support the scientific community in research related to cellular network performance and signal propagation.
